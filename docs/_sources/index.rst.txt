Hyperscience Flows SDK
=====================================
The ``flows_sdk`` is a Python library for programmatically building flows: sequences of business steps managed and executed by the Hyperscience Platform. These solutions are written in code, but are then manageable on the Hyperscience Platform.

Our documentation consists of the following sections:

* :ref:`pages/intro:Introduction to Flows SDK`: Explanations of system architecture, `flows_sdk` library structure, and basic concepts.
* :ref:`pages/tutorial:Tutorial`: A quickstart guide to deploying your first flow to the Hyperscience Platform.
* :ref:`pages/examples:Examples`: A library of fully executable flow examples. These can be used as templates for developing your own flows.
* :ref:`pages/custom_supervision:Custom Supervision`: A guide to configuring Custom Supervision templates.
* :ref:`pages/faq:FAQ`: Answers to frequently asked quesitons.
* :ref:`pages/source-docs:Source Documentation` & :ref:`pages/idp_32:IDP Library`: Definitions for all classes and functions in the `flows_sdk` library.

We encourage you to complete the :ref:`pages/tutorial:Tutorial` as the best way to get started.
