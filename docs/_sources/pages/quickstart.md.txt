# Quickstart

As part of this quickstart, we will build and deploy a simple Flow.

After completin the quickstart, you will:
- have a local environment with `flows-sdk` installed
- package a simple "Hello World" Flow into an artifact
- import that artifact into a running Hyperscience platform

While this quickstart imports a simple "Hello World" Flow, the same steps
are used when developing and exporting more complex flows like "Document Processing".

## Prerequisites

- python 3.7+

This quickstart assumes that you have a unix shell, but very similar steps can also be used for other
terminals.

## Steps

1. Create a virtual environment and source it

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install the flows_sdk package

    > Link below is used for illustrative purposes. Contact your CX representative for an exact installable link!

    ```bash
    pip install https://build-storage.int.hyperscience.com/flows_sdk/v0.1.2/flows_sdk-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

3. Download the Hello Flow example

    ```{eval-rst}
    :ref:`pages/examples:Hello Flow`
    ```

4. Package the example flow to a .json file

    ```bash
    python flow.py > hello_flow.json
    ```
    > the filename `flow.py` can be different depending on how you saved the file

5. upload the produced `hello_flow.json` to a running Hyperscience instance from `https://{hyperscience-url}/flows` -> Import Flow

If everything went as expected, you should be redirected to the Flow Studio:
